## **Introduction**

fitNUS is tailored for **NUS students** that are interested in staying healthy and keeping fit. It is suitable for **all
fitness levels** and is equipped with a **customisable timetable** for you to manage your time wisely and slot in your
workout routines with ease.

This developer guide is for users who are interested in our design philosophy and for future developers of fitNUS.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `FitNusBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("exercise_delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ExerciseDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the fitNUS data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>`, `ObservableList<Routine>` and `ObservableList<Lesson>`  that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FitNus`, which `Person` references. This allows `FitNus` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the fitNUS data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Create routine

The feature to create a routine in fitNUS is implemented using `RoutineCreateCommand` class, which inherits from
`Command` class. The argument is supplied after parsing the user input by the `RoutineCreateCommandParser` class.

It is important to note that the Routine object in question must not already exist within fitNUS.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the routine-creating mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `routine_create r/Leg Workout`.

**Step 2:**

This input is passed to `LogicManager` as a String and from there, the input is parsed by the `parseCommand`
method of `FitNusParser`.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command to create a Routine, so it calls the `parse` method of
`RoutineCreateCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

Within `parse`, the name of the routine is produced by `ParserUtil` parsing the given argument. This method then creates
the Routine object and returns it as an argument in the `RoutineCreateCommand`.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this returned `RoutineCreateCommand` to add the Routine into fitNUS.

**Step 6:**

`LogicManager` then saves the updated fitNUS data to the storage.

Given below is the sequence diagram showing how the routine creation command is executed:

![Routine Create](./images/RoutineAddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add Routine to Timetable

The `TimetableAddRoutineCommandParser` and `TimetableAddRoutineCommand` classes parse and execute the user input
to add a routine to the timetable in fitNUS.

The `TimetableAddRoutineCommandParser` class takes in the user input and parses them to return a
`TimetableAddRoutineCommand` object that contains the routine, day and duration. The `TimetableAddRoutineCommand` class
then executes the command by storing the slot in the timetable.

Note that for the command to be successful, the routine to be added has to exist in fitNUS.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `timetable_add_routine r/Leg workout D/Monday T/1600-1800`.

**Step 2:**

`LogicManager` takes in this input as a String and calls the `parseCommand` method of `FitNusParser` to parse this string.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command add a Routine to Timetable, so it calls the `parse` method of
`TimetableAddRoutineCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

The `parse` method calls the necessary methods of `ParserUtil` to parse the given argument and produce the name, day,
and duration. It uses the name to create the Routine object and returns this object, the day, and the duration as an
argument in `TimetableAddRoutineCommand`.<br>
Note that this Routine object is a placeholder, the actual Routine object in fitNUS is yet to be found.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of this returned `TimetableAddRoutineCommand` to add the Routine into the timetable.<br>
Note that the `execute` method retrieves the actual Routine object in fitNUS before adding it to the timetable.

**Step 6:**

`LogicManager` then saves the updated fitNUS data to the storage.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the
execute("timetable_add_routine r/Leg Workout D/Monday T/1600-1700") API call.

![TimetableAddRoutineSequenceDiagram](images/TimetableAddRoutineSequenceDiagram.png)

### Find exercises

The find exercises feature is implemented using `FindExercisesCommandParser`, as well as the following command:
* `FindExercisesCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command into fitNUS.

`FindExercisesCommandParser` takes in the user input and parses them to return a FindExercisesCommand containing the
corresponding predicate for finding the exercises. When executed, `FindExercisesCommand` will set the predicate of
the respective `FilteredList` for exercises in `ModelManager` such that only exercises matching the predicate will be
displayed in the list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find exercise mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `find_exercises bench`.

**Step 2:**

This input is passed to `LogicManager` as a String and from there, the input is parsed by the `parseCommand`
method of `FitNusParser`.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command to find exercises, so it calls the `parse` method of
`FindExercisesCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

Within `parse`, the keywords to match are added to a `List`, and an `ExerciseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object
is created based on this list. A `FindExercisesCommand` object is created using this
`ExerciseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this returned `FindExercisesCommand`.
Within `execute`, `ModelManager`'s `updateFilteredExerciseList` method is called with the
`ExerciseNameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as its argument. This filters out the relevant exercises.

**Step 6:**

The GUI then lists the filtered exercises.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the Logic component for the execute("find_exercises bench")
API call.

![FindExercisesSequenceDiagram](images/FindExercisesSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete lesson

The delete lesson feature is implemented using `LessonDeleteCommandParser`, as well as the following command:
* `LessonDeleteCommand`, to be executed when the user inputs the command into fitNUS.

`LessonDeleteCommandParser` takes in the user input and parses them to return a `LessonDeleteCommand` object. The
`LessonDeleteCommand` class then executes the command by deleting the lesson from the respective `FilteredList` for
lessons in `ModelManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete lesson mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1:**

The user types into fitNUS `lesson_delete 1`.

**Step 2:**

This input is passed to `LogicManager` as a String and from there, the input is parsed by the `parseCommand`
method of `FitNusParser`.

**Step 3:**

`parseCommand` identifies that this is a command to delete lesson, so it calls the `parse` method of
`LessonDeleteCommandParser` on the input.

**Step 4:**

Within `parse`, the name of the lesson is produced by `ParserUtil` parsing the given argument. This method then creates
the Lesson object.

**Step 5:**

`LogicManager` then calls the `execute` method of this returned `LessonDeleteCommand`.
Within `execute`, `ModelManager`'s `updateFilteredLessonList` method is called. This removes the unwanted lesson.

**Step 6:**

The GUI then lists the deleted lesson.
