## Project: fitNUS

### Overview

This portfolio page highlights some of my contributions to fitNUS - a Software Engineering Project developed in my third
year of undergraduate studies in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

### About the Team

We are a group of 5 Computer Science undergraduates from Year 2 and Year 3 reading CS2103T: Software Engineering.

#### About the Project

fitNUS represents a culmination of our team's efforts in morphing an existing [Address Book Level 3 (AB3) project](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3)
into a new product via Brownfield software development. fitNUS is a personal fitness tracker assistant which allows
users to create customised workout routines, by having the flexibility to add exercises to the routines they have
created. To facilitate workouts around their busy schedules, users have an added option of slotting lessons and routines
to their timetable.

The team has come up with a vast number of user-centric features to make fitNUS well-suited in order to provide both
convenience and utility in the long-run. Aimed at NUS students who are keen on improving their fitness levels, fitNUS is
the perfect solution in which the Graphical User Interface is integrated with Command Line Interface to provide a
wholesome user experience.

## Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to undo/redo previous commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

* **Code contributed**: You can view my code contributions to fitNUS [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=iqbxl&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-08-14&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other).

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.1` - `v1.4` (4 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
  * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())
